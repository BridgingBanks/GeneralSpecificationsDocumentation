Basic Community Bank workflow 

ADOPEM bank loans money to the President of each group. The president then uses the group treasurer to disburse sub-loans to the group members. Every 15 days members meet and pay part of their loan back to the treasurer who then takes the money back to the Presidnet who then pays back the loan to the bank.
