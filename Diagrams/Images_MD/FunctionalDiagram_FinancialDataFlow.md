In this model the President negotiates loans with the Bank and then disburses to Treasurer who then disburse to group members (this current version does not have the accurate arrows depicting the President disbursing to treasurer. Once members can pay back the loan they bring money to the group meeting and secretary records the collection of all money from treasurer using the Border Bank system. 

The point of this diagram is to track data points and flow through the system however there are still some aspects that need to be verified .

Functions allocated to the role "President" include:
* Guarentor of the Loans
* Approve Individual Members
